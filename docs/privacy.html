    <h2>SLAs for Trello Privacy Policy</h2>
        This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the SLAs for Trello Power-up.
    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <h3> Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            SLAs for Trello uses Google Analytics, which stores cookies on your computer. The data that is collected includes your IP address and the time of your visit.
        </p>
        <p>This information is not shared with third parties. </p>
            
        <p>If you wish to opt out of Google Analytics, there is a <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">browser add-on</a> that will allow you to do so.</p>
    <h3>Your Trello data</h3>
    <p> SLAs for Trello requires usage of Trello's API to gain data about the names of your lists (so that they can be shown in the settings UI) as well as actions that have been performed on the code (namely, the times the card has been dragged between lists) in order to calculate whether a card has met its SLA goals.</p>
    <p> Only the time relevant actions occurred is stored, and this is stored securely within Trello's Power-Up platform. This data is not shared with third parties, and is only used once the user has opted-in by authenticating with the SLAs for Trello Power-Up.</p>
